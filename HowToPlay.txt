HOW TO PLAY THE DICE GAME:

Dicey is a game	played with five dice.
You need 2 players.
The object of the game is to get three or more of a kind (i.e., 3 or more dice showing the same number).
To play the game, the first player rolls the five dice.

The	scoring	is	as	follows:
1 of a kind	- 0	points
2 of a kind	- 0	points - this is calculated	at the end of the player's turn
3 of a kind - 3	points
4 of a kind	- 4	points
5 of a kind	- 5	points

If the player rolls	2 of a kind	(i.e., two dice	which show the same	number), then the player gets to roll the remaining three dice again and is	then given the score according to the above	scoring	system.
The	second player now has a	turn at	rolling	the 5 dice.
Round 1	is finished	when both players have had a turn rolling the 5	dice.
A complete game	of Dicey consists of 3 rounds.
One	round consists of each player having one turn as described	above.
The	highest	score at the end of	the	three rounds wins.
